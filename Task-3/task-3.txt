Task 3 - Expectation Management & Cross-Functional Collaboration

Context:
    You have two tasks above (Task 1 & Task 2). Take tomorrow’s date as the original due date for
    both tasks. There is a family emergency at your place due to which you won’t be able to meet
    the due date of the above tasks for at least 3 more days. Task 1 is for a low-priority customer
    who has not provided any go-live date to us. Task 2 is for a priority customer whose campaign
    needs to go live in the next 2 days.

Note - You can only ask for an extension for 1 task from the above.

Task:

    1. What will be your approach to solving this issue? Explain your strategy and approach to
    this.
    2. How will you inform the 2 separate account managers of both customers about your
    approach? Write an internal message informing Manoj (Account manager for Task 1) &
    Ravi (Account Manager for Task 2) about your respective approach.
    3. How will you communicate the delay of additional 3 days to the customer? (Write an
    email to the customer informing them about this).




Ans 1. My approach to solving this issue would be prioritizing the tasks based on their urgency and importance.
    Since Task 2 is for a priority customer and their campaign needs to go live in the next 2 days, I would ask for an extension 
    for Task 1 and complete Task 2 as per the original due date. To minimize the impact of the delay, I would try to work on Task 1
    in parallel with Task 2 to complete it as soon as possible.

    In order to prioritize the tasks effectively, I will try to finish the work for Task 2 as soon as possible to minimize the
    impact on the priority customer and then complete Task 1 with the extension time.
    This approach ensures that the priority customer's requirements are met and the low-priority customer's work is also not neglected.
